## Bashi
### A theme for ZSH.

![Flat UI](imgs/sample.png)

I like to use it with Ahmet SÃ¼lek's [Flat UI Terminal
Theme](https://github.com/ahmetsulek/flat-terminal) or Pasquale D'Silva's [Saturn Terminal Theme](https://github.com/psql/saturn-colors).

Curious about the squiggly bit? It is a punctuation mark from the [Sinhala alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinhala_alphabet) used by the Sinhala people in Sri Lanka.

The theme is named after my dog...also named Bashi.
